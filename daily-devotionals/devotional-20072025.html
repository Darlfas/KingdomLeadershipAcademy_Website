                <h2 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>The Transfiguration was not just a miracle—it was a message. A divine preview of what is possible when mortal men ascend the high places of intimacy with Christ. Jesus didn’t take all His disciples. He took three—Peter, James, and John. The rest remained at the base. Why? Because access to heavenly dimensions on earth is not a gift to the crowd; it’s a reward for the few who dare to climb.</p>
                <p>This powerful encounter—where Jesus shined like the sun and heaven collided with earth—was a prophetic revelation of the Mount Sion lifestyle God desires for every believer. But only a fraction ever experience it. Why? Because only a remnant leaves religion for revelation. Only a few move beyond church routine to actual Kingdom reality.</p>
                <p>In this generation, many are content with the valley. But Heaven is calling us higher—to the mountain where transfiguration happens. It’s time to stop playing church and start pressing into heaven-on-earth. The mountain is waiting. Will you climb?</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h2>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Transfiguration Was a Glimpse of Heaven-on-Earth</strong><br>Jesus didn’t change form—He revealed what was always within Him. The mountaintop experience shows us that glory isn’t just for the afterlife—it’s the inheritance of the spiritually awakened now.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You carry glory—but only those who ascend can express it.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Jesus Selectively Took a Remnant to the Mountaintop</strong><br>Only 3 out of 12 were chosen. This wasn’t favoritism—it was prophetic. Not all believers will experience Kingdom glory on earth. Only those willing to leave the crowd, climb the mountain, and stay in His presence will see heaven revealed.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The top is not for the casual—it’s for the consecrated.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Mountaintop Encounters Require Separation</strong><br>Jesus took them “apart” into a high mountain. The Transfiguration happened after six days of prophetic silence. Glory follows separation, not just excitement. You must disconnect from distractions to connect with divine dimensions.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The deeper the consecration, the higher the elevation.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Transfiguration Experience Rewrites Earthly Identity</strong><br>The Apostles saw Jesus differently—and in doing so, discovered their own future glory. When you behold Him in His unveiled splendor, you begin to reflect that same image (2 Corinthians 3:18).</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Beholding is becoming—glory is contagious on the mountain.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Not All Will Experience Heaven-on-Earth—But You Can</strong><br>Only 25% of the disciples were present. And in today’s Church, it’s the same. Few believe that God wants them to live heaven on earth. But you can be among the few who believe, pursue, and walk in this reality.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Don’t settle for church as usual—press into Mount Sion glory.</em></p>
                    </li>

                <h2 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY</h2>
                <p>The Transfiguration was an invitation. Jesus showed us that what’s inside a yielded life can shine like the sun. But it’s not automatic. Many will talk about heaven; few will live it. Many will sing about glory; few will carry it. Don’t wait until eternity to live the life you were born to manifest now. Heaven is calling you up. Leave religion. Climb the mountain. Step into your own Transfiguration Experience.</p>

            <div class="devotional-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">PRAYER</h2>
                <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the mountain of transfiguration. I choose today to rise above the distractions of religion and routine. I want to live in the glory You’ve ordained for me. Jesus, take me higher. Holy Spirit, separate me, sanctify me, and saturate me with the atmosphere of heaven-on-earth. Let my life be a reflection of Mount Sion realities. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
