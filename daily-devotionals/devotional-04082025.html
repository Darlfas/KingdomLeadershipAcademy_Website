                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>There is a growing deception creeping into the Body of Christ—a gospel that says your real problem is your bloodline foundation. But the truth is clear: your true foundation is Christ, not your ancestors. The New Testament does not call you to break from the past—it calls you to walk in the new creation reality. You are no longer of Adam’s fallen lineage—you are now a citizen of the Kingdom of God, born into the eternal family of Jesus Christ. Yes, your natural background may explain your history—but it cannot define your destiny. The day you were born again, a foundation exchange happened. What the cross accomplished is total. To teach otherwise is to reduce the Gospel to superstition and drag believers back into Old Covenant shadows that no longer apply to us in Christ.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>The New Birth Gave You a New Foundation</strong><br>
                        You are not being renovated—you were reborn in Christ. The old is gone; the new has come.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Your new origin is not your family tree—it’s Calvary.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Christ Alone Is the Legal Foundation of the Church</strong><br>
                        There is no scriptural authority for believers to trace their foundation to their grandparents. That’s a spiritual scam.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Christ is the Rock—not your village altar.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Misinterpreting the Old Testament Leads to Confusion</strong><br>
                        The curses, genealogies, and ancestral issues in the Old Testament were never addressed to the Church.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>If it’s not in the New Covenant, it’s not your portion.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wrong Foundations Create Powerless Believers</strong><br>
                        As long as believers think they are victims of ancestral foundations, they will never walk in the victory of the cross.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>A lie believed will limit a truth received.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Apostolic Blueprint Leaves No Room for Bloodline Battles</strong><br>
                        From Acts 2 to Revelation, there is no doctrine of bloodline deliverance for born-again believers. The apostles taught Christ alone as our source, root, and builder.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Fight the good fight of faith—not shadows of a false battle.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>You are not the product of your earthly lineage—you are the expression of divine resurrection power. Stop wasting spiritual energy on fictitious enemies. Your foundation is not in a shrine—it is seated at the right hand of God in glory. The moment you believed, you were repositioned in Christ. Any gospel that makes your redemption incomplete is a counterfeit. If Christ is your foundation, then live like it—stand firm, stand free, stand finished.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for becoming my true and eternal foundation. I renounce every lie that ties me to a defeated past. I stand firm on the Rock that cannot be shaken. Holy Spirit, illuminate my understanding. Let me walk boldly in the revelation of my new creation identity. Help me rightly divide the Word of truth and teach others the full Gospel of liberty in Christ. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
