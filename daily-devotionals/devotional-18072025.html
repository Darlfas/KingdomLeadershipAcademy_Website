                    <div class="key-scripture-box"> <p class="key-scripture-label">KEY SCRIPTURE</p> <p class="bible-quote">“Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.”</p> <cite class="bible-verse-ref">Hebrews 5:8 (KJV)</cite> </div>
                </div>

                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3> <p>Jesus—the perfect Son of God—had to learn obedience through suffering. This profound truth shatters our shallow expectations of Spirit-led comfort and introduces us to the fiery school of glory. The same Spirit that descended like a dove upon Jesus at His baptism also drove Him into the wilderness to suffer.</p>
                <p>The Spirit-led life is not pain-free—it is purpose-filled. Obedience is not always easy, but it is always glorious. If Jesus was not exempt from suffering in His journey of submission to the Holy Spirit, then no true son is. To walk in the fullness of Mount Sion—the realm of glory, holiness, and divine authority—we must be prepared to follow the Spirit even into the flames of sacrifice. The measure of our glory is directly tied to the depth of our submission.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3> <ol class="lesson-points"> <li><strong>Even Jesus Had to Learn Obedience Through Suffering</strong><br>
                        Jesus, though sinless, had to be trained in obedience by the things He suffered. His submission wasn’t automatic—it was a conscious choice to embrace the Spirit’s leadership, even unto pain.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>If Jesus submitted to suffer, then our sonship demands nothing less.</em></p> </li>
                    <li><strong>Spirit-Led Suffering is a Pathway, Not a Punishment</strong><br>
                        God’s Spirit doesn’t just lead us to miracles—He leads us to maturity. Physical discomfort is not a sign of disfavor; it is often the divine proof that we are being conformed to Christ.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The wilderness may bruise the body, but it builds the spirit.</em></p> </li>
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Empowers You to Say No to Sin—Even at a Cost</strong><br>
                        Jesus lived sinless on earth by the power of the Spirit. Every time He overcame temptation, He did so in submission. Obedience isn’t just about willpower—it’s about being led by the Spirit to crucify the flesh.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Purity costs. Holiness hurts. But glory awaits.</em></p> </li>
                    <li><strong>Manifesting Mount Sion Requires Full Surrender</strong><br>
                        You cannot carry Zion's glory and cling to self-comfort. The more surrendered you are, the more weight of the world to come you can carry.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Zion is not cheap. It is costly obedience made visible in glory.</em></p> </li>
                    <li><strong>The Holy Spirit Will Lead You Where Flesh Dies and Faith Rises</strong><br>
                        The same Spirit who raised Christ from the dead will lead you to die daily—to your own desires, comfort zones, and fears. That death births unshakable Kingdom life.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Until your flesh yields, your spirit cannot reign.</em></p> </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY</h3> <p>Don’t run from the cost—run into the fire. Jesus, our Forerunner, obeyed through suffering and was crowned with glory. The Spirit is not just your Comforter—He is your Trainer. Every pain endured in obedience is a seed of eternal reward. What the Spirit leads you into, He will glorify you through. If Jesus suffered to obey, then you are in the right company when your obedience costs you everything.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3> <p>Holy Spirit, I yield my life to Your leadership—even when it hurts. Train me like You trained Jesus. Teach me to obey through suffering. Let my trials become my testimony, and let the fire refine me for glory. I choose Mount Sion, no matter the cost. Make me a son that carries the fullness of the life to come. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
