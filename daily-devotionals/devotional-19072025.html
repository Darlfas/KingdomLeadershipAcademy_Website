                <h2 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>Jesus came not only to die for our sins, but to model the lifestyle of a Spirit-led Son. His miracles, His choices, even His moments of silence were all authored by the Holy Spirit. True sonship is not a title—it’s a trail. Jesus blazed the path, and now He calls us to walk it.</p>
                <p>Romans 8:14 is not a poetic verse—it’s the definition of sonship. The proof that you are God’s son is not just your confession, but your submission. To be led by the Spirit is the highest demonstration of divine maturity. In Christ, we are not just called to be saved—we are called to be led. Jesus is the Pattern Son. If He needed to follow the Spirit, then we must passionately pursue that same leadership every day.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h2>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Jesus Qualified as the Son of God by Being Spirit-Led</strong><br>Though eternally the Son, Jesus demonstrated His sonship on earth by yielding entirely to the Spirit. Every decision flowed from divine leading.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>If the Son of God needed to be led, how much more do we?</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Sonship Is Measured by Submission, Not Just Birth</strong><br>Being born again gives us legal sonship, but only Spirit-led obedience reveals functional sonship. The moment we stop following the Spirit, we stop living as sons.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Salvation starts sonship—submission grows it.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Holy Spirit Defines the Lifestyle of the Sons of God</strong><br>Jesus lived by every word the Father spoke. Likewise, true sons live by the whispers of the Spirit, not just by logic, ambition, or emotion.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You can’t walk in Mount Sion realities with a carnal compass.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Spirit-Led Life Requires Sacrifice and Sensitivity</strong><br>Following the Spirit demands dying to self daily—sometimes saying “no” to good things to say “yes” to God-things. It’s a daily cross for eternal crown.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>If your flesh is always comfortable, your spirit might be out of alignment.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Jesus Leads a Generation of Sons Into Glory</strong><br>Hebrews 2:10 says He is bringing many sons to glory. He is not just our Savior—He is our Forerunner. Those who follow Him by the Spirit will share in His authority.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Sonship is your destiny. Spirit-led living is your pathway.</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY</h2>
                <p>The Kingdom is not inherited by church attendance or spiritual jargon—it is manifested by Spirit-led living. Jesus set the pace. He showed us what it means to walk in Mount Sion authority: total, joyful, radical obedience to the Holy Spirit. Every day you wake up, make it your passion to be led—because in every leading, the Father is revealing His sons.</p>

            <div class="devotional-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">PRAYER</h2>
                <p>Father, thank You for sending Jesus to model true sonship. I declare that I am not just saved—I am surrendered. Holy Spirit, lead me daily, train me deeply, and empower me fully to follow Jesus in every step. Make me one of the sons You are raising to reveal Your glory. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
