                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>The secret behind the exploits of the early Church was their unshakable conviction that Christ alone is the foundation—nothing else, no one else. The Apostles didn't build on Jewish tradition, prophetic rituals, or inherited religious structures. They built on Christ crucified, risen, and revealed. Apostle Paul, in particular, received a divine blueprint—a grace that disconnected him from religious patterns so he could unveil the mystery of Christ to the nations. While others were still entangled in the shadows of Moses, Paul stepped boldly into the substance of Christ, even when misunderstood by his peers. This boldness wasn’t rebellion—it was revelation. Today, in these end times, God is raising voices again—apostolic and prophetic reformers who are sounding the alarm: No other foundation can stand but Christ alone! Many in the Body of Christ are still building on old traditions, denominational doctrines, and prophetic distractions. But Heaven is calling for a return to the only Foundation that was ever approved—Christ Himself.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>The Apostolic Church Had One Focus—Christ</strong><br>
                        The early apostles were laser-focused. Their gospel was not about systems or shadows, but the person of Christ.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Jesus wasn’t part of their message—He was the message.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Paul Carried a Peculiar Grace to Reveal the Mystery</strong><br>
                        Paul wasn’t self-appointed. He was divinely anointed to reveal the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8).
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>His revelation wasn't second-hand—it came straight from Heaven.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Revelation Will Always Clash With Religion</strong><br>
                        Paul's message was so new it offended the old wineskins—even Peter hesitated at first (Gal. 2:11–12).
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>True revelation is often first rejected before it's received.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Christ Alone Is the Authorized Blueprint</strong><br>
                        No matter how powerful a man of God is—if the foundation is not Christ, the building is illegal.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Any gospel not centered on Christ crucified is a spiritual scam.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>A New Apostolic Voice Must Rise Again</strong><br>
                        Like Paul, we must boldly confront religious systems that resist the finished work of Christ.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The Church must stop echoing culture and start declaring Christ.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>God never gave us multiple foundations. Only One—and that is Christ. The early apostles knew it. They died for it. And now, in these last days, we must rise in that same spirit. The foundation of denominations, ancestral altars, generational curses, and law-based spirituality must collapse before the revelation of Christ alone. This is not just doctrine—it is war. It’s time to tear down what God never built and rebuild on the Rock of Christ. We don’t need another revival—we need a reformation. A returning to the original foundation laid by the Apostles and Prophets—Jesus Christ Himself (Eph. 2:20). No gimmicks. No mixture. Just Christ alone.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Father, open the eyes of the Church again. Tear down every foundation not laid by You. Raise new apostolic voices with boldness and purity like Paul. I declare that I will not build on tradition, fear, or religious noise. I will build only on Christ—my Foundation, my Cornerstone, my All. Let this generation know You—not as a theology—but as the only True Foundation. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
