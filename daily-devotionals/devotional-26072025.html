                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>The Mountain of Transfiguration was Heaven’s embassy on earth—and the Holy Spirit was the Divine Operator behind the scenes. While the Father declared and the Son was revealed, it was the Spirit who manifested the glory, orchestrated the transformation, and opened human senses to the divine dimension. The bright cloud that overshadowed them wasn’t mere weather—it was the visible glory of the Spirit at work, wrapping the mountain in Heaven's atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Today, we live in the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, and He is still the One appointed to carry believers into the reality of divine encounters. Understanding and walking with Him is no longer optional—it is vital.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Is the Power Behind Transfiguration</strong><br>
                        It was by the Spirit that Jesus’ body was transfigured—His face shone and His garments glowed white. The Spirit glorifies the Son in visible, undeniable ways.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Transformation isn’t behavior modification—it is Spirit-induced glorification.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Is the Voice-Projector of the Father</strong><br>
                        The thunderous voice from Heaven? The Spirit carried it. Without the Holy Spirit, men can’t hear God. He opens the ears of the heart to Heaven’s frequency.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The Spirit doesn’t just speak for God—He makes us hear God.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Is the Revelator of the Unseen Realm</strong><br>
                        The Apostles saw Moses and Elijah by revelation—not imagination. It was the Holy Spirit who unveiled eternity to them.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Every prophetic vision is born where the Spirit opens eyes.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Manifests God’s Glory Tangibly</strong><br>
                        The bright cloud that enveloped the mountain was the Shekinah—the manifest presence of the Spirit. This was no fog—it was the evidence of Heaven on earth.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>When the Spirit rests, the natural bends to the supernatural.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Is Heaven’s Guide Into Divine Experience</strong><br>
                        Just as He led Jesus into the wilderness, He now leads the Church into realms of transfiguration. You can’t access God’s glory zones without His escort.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The Spirit isn’t a feeling—He’s the Governor of glory.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>The Transfiguration was not a solo act—it was a Triune orchestration. The Holy Spirit’s role was central then, and it remains central now. Every divine encounter, every moment of true transformation, every hearing of God’s voice—is Spirit-enabled.</p>
                <p>We cannot walk in Kingdom dominion without the daily partnership of the Holy Spirit. If we want Heaven-on-Earth, we must walk in step with the One who brings Heaven down—the Spirit of God.</p>
                <p>Let Him overshadow your mountain. Let Him transfigure your life.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Holy Spirit, I honor You as the Operator of all divine encounters. I surrender afresh to Your leading. Let Your cloud cover my life. Let my ears be opened to the voice of the Father. Transform me as You transformed Jesus—make me a visible reflection of Heaven’s glory. Take me by the hand and lead me into realms where the supernatural is natural. I long to walk with You more deeply than ever before. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
