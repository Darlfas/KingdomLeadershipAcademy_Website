                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Before God predestined you, He foreknew you. This is not poetic—it is prophetic. Romans 8:29 unveils a divine order: foreknowledge → predestination → calling → justification → glorification. The foundation of your destiny is God’s eternal knowledge of you. Somewhere in eternity past, God didn’t just imagine you—He finished you. He wrote your story in the volume of the Book (Hebrews 10:7–9), then placed you in time to manifest it. You are not a mystery to God; you are a masterpiece in motion. However, foreknowledge does not make you passive. It invites you to search the script of your life in Christ and align with what was written. Until you preview what God preplanned, you cannot fully manifest your purpose.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>Foreknowledge is God’s Eternal Awareness of You</strong><br>
                        Jeremiah 1:5—“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.”
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You existed in God’s mind before you appeared in time.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Predestination Flows from Foreknowledge</strong><br>
                        Romans 8:29—He foreknew, then He predestined.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>God didn’t plan blindly; He planned based on perfect knowledge.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Your Destiny is Written, Not Improvised</strong><br>
                        Hebrews 10:7—“In the volume of the book it is written of me.”
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Life is not an experiment; it’s a fulfillment of what was scripted.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Revelation Unlocks What Foreknowledge Concealed</strong><br>
                        1 Corinthians 2:7—God ordained wisdom for our glory before time.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The Holy Spirit reveals what eternity already settled.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Responsibility Turns Blueprint into Reality</strong><br>
                        Psalm 139:16—All your days were written before one came to be.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You must partner with God through prayer, obedience, and insight to manifest what was foreseen.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>Foreknowledge means your life began in eternity, not in your mother’s womb. But predestination is not automation—you must discover and walk in what was written. Until you see the script, you cannot manifest the story.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Father, thank You for knowing me before time began. Open my eyes to the book of destiny You wrote for me in Christ. Deliver me from distractions and ignorance, and align my steps with Your eternal script. I refuse to live by chance—I choose to walk in what was foreknown and predestined for my glory. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY BIBLE READING</h3>
                <p>Romans 8:29, Hebrews 10:7–9, Jeremiah 1:5, Psalm 139:16, Isaiah 46:10, 1 Peter 1:2.</p>
