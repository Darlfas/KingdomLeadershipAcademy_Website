                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>The Gospel is not a promise waiting to be fulfilled—it is the announcement of a finished reality. A promise looks forward to what will be done; the Gospel declares what has already been done in Christ. The Law pointed to the cross; Grace points back to it. Before the resurrection, the prophets spoke in shadows and types. After the resurrection, the apostles spoke in substance and revelation. Paul called it a “mystery hidden for ages but now revealed” (Col. 1:26). This revelation is not about what God might do—it is about what He has done. When Jesus cried, “It is finished” (John 19:30), Heaven’s work for man’s redemption was completed. The believer’s task is not to strive for fulfillment, but to live from the fulfillment already secured in Christ.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>The Gospel Is a Revelation, Not a Future Contract</strong><br>
                        Romans 16:25—The preaching of Jesus Christ is the revealing of a mystery kept secret but now made manifest.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The cross was not an installment plan—it was full payment.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>A Promise Points Forward, Revelation Brings You Into Now</strong><br>
                        Hebrews 4:3—We who have believed do enter into rest.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Faith is not hoping God will act—it is resting in what God has done.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Christ’s Work Is Once for All</strong><br>
                        Hebrews 9:12—By His own blood He entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Nothing left pending, nothing left to add.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Apostolic Gospel Carries No Delay</strong><br>
                        Galatians 1:11–12—Paul’s Gospel was received by revelation, not human tradition.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>A promise can be debated; a revelation is undeniable once seen.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Living in Revelation Produces Unshakable Faith</strong><br>
                        Colossians 1:27—Christ in you is not a prophecy—it is present reality.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>This is the foundation the enemy cannot overthrow.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>The Gospel is not an IOU from Heaven—it is a completed transaction, sealed by the blood of Christ, and revealed to the saints. To treat it as a promise is to postpone your inheritance. To see it as revelation is to step into what Christ has already secured. Stop waiting for what is already yours. You are not heading toward victory—you are standing in it.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Father, thank You for the finished work of Christ. Open the eyes of my spirit to see the fullness of what You have already accomplished. Deliver me from every mindset that postpones my inheritance. I declare that I live, walk, and minister from the place of completion in Christ. My life will be an expression of the revealed Gospel—Christ in me, the hope of glory. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
