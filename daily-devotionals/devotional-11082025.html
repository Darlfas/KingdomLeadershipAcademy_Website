                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Predestination is not a theological puzzle—it’s a Kingdom reality. In Christ, God didn’t just foresee your life, He pre-designed it. Before the foundation of the world, He scripted your destiny, finished your story, and then placed you in time to walk it out. This means your journey is not a random survival game—it’s a divine replay of what has already been perfected in eternity. Romans 8:29–30 shows a divine sequence: foreknown → predestined → called → justified → glorified. Notice “glorified” is in past tense—it’s already done in God’s reality. You’re not trying to become what God planned—you’re discovering and expressing it. This truth demolishes the fear of failure, because you were not launched to improvise—you were sent to manifest.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>Predestination Began Before Time</strong><br>
                        Ephesians 1:4—Chosen before the foundation of the world.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You are older than time in God’s mind.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>God Finished You Before He Started You</strong><br>
                        Isaiah 46:10—He declares the end from the beginning.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Life is not an experiment—it’s a fulfillment.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Your Calling Is a Replay of Eternity’s Script</strong><br>
                        2 Timothy 1:9—Purpose and grace were given before the world began.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You’re here to reveal, not to guess.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Predestination Is Christ-Centered, Not Man-Centered</strong><br>
                        Romans 8:29—We were predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Christ is both your starting point and your destination.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Discovery Unlocks Destiny</strong><br>
                        Jeremiah 1:5—“Before you were born, I sanctified you.”
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Your real fight is not to create yourself, but to find yourself in Him.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>In the Kingdom, predestination is God’s guarantee that your life is not random. The Author has already finished your story in Christ. Your job is not to rewrite it, but to walk in revelation until what’s hidden in eternity becomes visible in time. You are not here to survive—you are here to manifest.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Father, thank You for finishing my destiny before I began my journey. Open my eyes to see who I am in Christ from Your eternal perspective. I renounce every fear, confusion, and self-invented identity. I choose to walk in the finished script You wrote for me in Christ before time began. My life will be a living proof of Your predestined glory. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
