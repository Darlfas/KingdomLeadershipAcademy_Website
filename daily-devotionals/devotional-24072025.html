                <p>What happened on the Mount of Transfiguration was more than a mystical encounter—it was a governmental assembly. Heaven touched earth. Not just in light, not just in voice—but in the appearance of resurrected citizens of the Heavenly City.</p>
                <p>Moses and Elijah appeared in glorious, immortal form, not as ghosts, but as glorified men. These weren’t angelic beings—they were human vessels who had conquered death by faith. Their presence speaks volumes about what God expects of His people and what’s possible when Kingdom dominion is fully embraced.</p>
                <p>They didn’t show up as passive spectators. They arrived on assignment. They came as heavenly consultants—to speak with Jesus about His soon-to-be-accomplished mission on the Cross. And in doing so, they became a prophetic picture of what Kingdom citizens look like when they overcome death and step fully into their heavenly identities—even while still connected to earthly history.</p>

                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Heaven Is Involved in Earthly Assignments</strong><br>Moses and Elijah came from glory to speak with Jesus about His mission. This wasn’t a random visit. Heaven partners with earth when divine purpose is at stake.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Your destiny is not a private journey—it’s part of an eternal agenda.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Resurrected Men in Glorified Bodies Are the Pattern of the Age to Come</strong><br>Moses and Elijah didn’t appear as floating spirits. They appeared as resurrected men—fully alive and clothed in light. They model the future of the redeemed.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>God’s goal isn’t just to save your soul—but to glorify your body.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>They Represent Conquest Over Death by Faith</strong><br>Elijah didn’t die—he was taken. Moses’ strength never diminished, and God Himself took him. These weren’t just men of power; they were proofs of dominion over mortality.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Faith doesn’t just survive life—it subdues death.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Heaven Selects Faithful Witnesses for Eternal Missions</strong><br>Not everyone could stand on that mountain. God chose men who finished their race in faith, men who ascended in victory. Their witness was needed at Jesus’ most crucial moment.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Your faithfulness today may qualify you for heavenly missions tomorrow.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Transfiguration Is a Preview of the Glorious Church</strong><br>What Jesus, Moses, and Elijah displayed on that mountain wasn’t just past glory—it was a prophetic prototype of the glorified, overcoming Church.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The Church isn’t waiting to be glorious—it’s rising into glory.</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY</h2>
                <p>This encounter shows us that Heaven is not distant—it is present where divine purpose converges with faith. Moses and Elijah stepped out of eternity to meet Jesus on time. Their presence affirms that death is not the end—it’s just a door for those who walk with God.</p>
                <p>Elijah defied death by fire. Moses defeated aging by divine intimacy. And both stood beside the Son of God to bear witness to His redemptive mission.</p>
                <p>These are not just stories—they are standards. The Church is being called into the same glory. The same faith that took Elijah in a chariot and preserved Moses’ vitality is at work in us today. If Jesus could be transfigured—and He said we’d do His works and more—then these glorious manifestations are not mythology, but ministry goals.</p>
                <p>You are not just a churchgoer—you are a heavenly citizen, being trained for eternal assignments. You were born again not just to escape hell, but to embody heaven—even now.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">PRAYER</h2>
                <p>Father, thank You for revealing to me that Heaven is closer than I think. I receive the vision of Moses and Elijah not as fairy tales, but as heavenly realities. Make me a man or woman who defies death by intimacy with You. Let my faith rise to the realm where my life becomes a portal for divine glory. Prepare me now for future assignments in eternity. As Moses and Elijah stood in the cloud of glory, let me too ascend into Your presence and walk in the reality of my heavenly citizenship. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
