                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Enoch is proof that walking with God is not about religion—it’s about relationship. He didn’t have a church title or a religious label, but he mastered one thing: walking in intimate fellowship with God by faith. That walk was powered by the Person of the Holy Spirit—the same Spirit now dwelling in us. Just like Enoch, you too can walk beyond limitation, beyond corruption, and into Mount Sion—the eternal dimension of God’s presence. The question is not if it’s possible, but how surrendered are you to the Spirit?</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>Enoch’s Walk Was Powered by the Spirit</strong><br>
                        Enoch didn’t guess his way into Mount Sion—he knew the Spirit and walked with Him until eternity opened.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Walking with God begins by walking with the Holy Spirit.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Holy Spirit Is Heaven’s Companion on Earth</strong><br>
                        He was sent not just to help you but to lead you into all truth—including how to live as a citizen of Mount Sion.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>He’s not a tool—He’s a Person to be known.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>God Picks Walkers, Not Watchers</strong><br>
                        Enoch was one among billions—but he chose the narrow path of intimacy. God is still seeking men who will walk, not spectate.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Heaven is not impressed by attendance but by alignment.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Religion Can’t Replace Relationship</strong><br>
                        Church membership doesn’t equal divine partnership. Many are in the pews but not in the walk.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Mount Sion is reserved for those who move with God.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Leads Beyond Human Limits</strong><br>
                        The same Spirit who carried Enoch beyond death is available to you now. He reveals God, empowers your journey, and takes you where flesh can’t go.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>With the Spirit, you can live above time, sin, fear, and death.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>If Enoch could walk with God without a Bible, a church building, or a Christian title, what’s your excuse? The Spirit is calling you—not just to believe, but to walk. The invitation to Mount Sion is not for the religious—it’s for the responsive. Surrender to the Spirit. Know Him. Love Him. Follow Him. Your walk may start in secret, but it will end in glory.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Holy Spirit, I want to walk with You like Enoch did. Strip me of empty religion. Deliver me from surface Christianity. Lead me into deeper fellowship with You. Teach me to hear You, follow You, and honor You daily. I choose the narrow path of intimacy. I want Mount Sion to be my destination and my reality. Take me beyond limitation—into the heart of God. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
