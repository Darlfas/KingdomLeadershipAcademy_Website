                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Mount Sion is not accessed by the natural senses. It’s a spiritual realm that can only be walked into by faith. We are not called to figure out the Rapture journey through logic, emotions, or religious activity—we are called to walk it out by faith through intimacy with the Holy Spirit. This faith-walk doesn’t begin with your feelings—it begins with a revelation from God’s Word and a total dependence on it. If the Rapture is our spiritual destination, then Faith is the vehicle, and the Holy Spirit is the GPS guiding us through God’s Word.</p>
                <p>Without faith, it is impossible to journey into the fullness of Mount Sion, for faith is the only legal currency that grants you access to Kingdom inheritance. Today’s devotional is your call back to the foundation—to re-align your Christian walk not around church activity, but around the Person of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God that produces faith.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>Faith is the Walkway to Mount Sion</strong><br>
                        Faith is not an option—it is the ordained system for our journey to the Rapture. From salvation to glorification, everything in the Kingdom flows through faith.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Walking into Sion is not a leap—it’s a step-by-step faith walk.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Word of God Is the Birthplace of Faith</strong><br>
                        Faith comes only by hearing the Word (Romans 10:17). You cannot walk in what you do not hear, and you cannot believe what has not been revealed.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>To be rich in faith, you must be rich in the Word.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Holy Spirit Is the One Who Activates Faith Through Revelation</strong><br>
                        The Spirit doesn't just whisper encouragement—He unveils Kingdom truths that spark supernatural belief.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The Spirit speaks what the Word says—and empowers you to believe it.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Everything You Need in the Kingdom Must Be Bought by Faith</strong><br>
                        You don’t receive healing, provision, holiness, or rapture-readiness by struggle—you access it by faith. Faith is the divine transaction system.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Prayer, fasting, and fellowship are tools to acquire and grow faith—not substitutes for it.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Religion Must Submit to Revelation</strong><br>
                        Church activities that do not produce faith are distractions. Mount Sion is not a reward for busyness but for believers who’ve walked in faith by the Spirit.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The end-time Church must shift from religious routines to revelatory realities.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>You are not called to figure out this Rapture journey—you are called to walk it out by faith. Stop depending on feelings, formulas, or your five senses. Instead, immerse yourself in the Word, allow the Holy Spirit to reveal it to you, and act on it as if it’s more real than the ground beneath your feet. This is not just Christianity—it’s Kingdom living.</p>
                <p>The golden streets of Zion are only for those who walk by golden faith.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Holy Spirit, teach me to walk by faith and not by sight. I reject shallow religion and choose deep revelation. Flood my heart with light. Let Your Word become my daily bread, and let it ignite faith in every area of my life. I depend on You alone. Guide me step-by-step into Mount Sion. Empower me to buy every Kingdom blessing with the currency of faith. Let my life be a testimony of trust, transformation, and total surrender. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
