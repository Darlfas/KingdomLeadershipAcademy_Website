                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Mount Sion is not a religious idea—it is your original inheritance in God. Every human, whether saved or not, was created with a divine destiny designed to reflect the pattern of Christ. This destiny is part of the eternal reality called Mount Sion. While many chase the temporary blessings of earth, Mount Sion holds the fullness of what God ordained before time. The Holy Spirit is not just a helper—He is the divine Revealer of your true inheritance.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>Every Man Carries a Hidden Inheritance</strong><br>
                        You were not born empty. God pre-packed your life with purpose, identity, and eternal blessings.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>To ignore this is to insult your divine design.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mount Sion Is More Than a Place—It’s a Package</strong><br>
                        It represents your full inheritance in Christ—peace, purpose, dominion, identity, and eternal glory.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>It’s your destination and your design.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Holy Spirit Was Sent to Unveil What’s Yours</strong><br>
                        Just as Jesus came to save, the Spirit came to reveal. His mission is to open your eyes to what belongs to you in Christ.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>No Spirit, no sight—no sight, no possession.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Earthly Blessings Are Just Fragments</strong><br>
                        What many call “success” is merely a sliver of what Mount Sion holds. Don’t settle for shadows—go after substance.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Your true blessing is spiritual before it's physical.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Your Destiny Can’t Be Accessed Without Revelation</strong><br>
                        Only the Holy Spirit can decode what Heaven encoded. You must partner with Him to walk in your full inheritance.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>What you don’t know, you can’t claim.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>You are not an accident—you are a carrier of divine inheritance. Mount Sion is your birthright, and the Holy Spirit is your Revealer. Refuse to live beneath your design. Don’t let the noise of earthly pursuits drown out the whisper of eternal purpose. Every man was made for more—but only those who walk with the Holy Spirit will see the more. The revelation of Mount Sion is not optional—it is essential.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Holy Spirit, I recognize You as the One sent to reveal what belongs to me. Open my eyes to the inheritance I’ve ignored. Help me to stop chasing fragments and start pursuing fullness. Reveal to me the riches of Mount Sion. Teach me what has been freely given by the Father. Make me a living expression of Heaven’s inheritance. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
