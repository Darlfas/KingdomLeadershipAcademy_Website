                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Mount Sion represents the full expression of our eternal inheritance—the divine lifestyle God intends for His sons on earth. Yet, this Kingdom reality remains largely hidden because many believers are still functioning under earthly systems, depending on human logic and worldly structures for survival. The reason is simple: true sonship requires total submission to the leadership of the Holy Spirit. God’s government is Spirit-led, not self-led. And until we make Him our sole source, the manifestation of the Kingdom in our lives will remain partial or stifled.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>The Kingdom Has a Source System</strong><br>
                        Christianity is not a religion of effort, but a Kingdom of dependence. God's sons are not powered by human systems but by the Spirit-led supply of Heaven.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You can't manifest Mount Sion while plugged into Babylon.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Sonship Is Proven by Submission to the Spirit</strong><br>
                        Romans 8:14 doesn’t say “churchgoers,” but those led by the Spirit are sons. Refusing divine leadership disqualifies one from Kingdom inheritance.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Obedience is the gateway to dominion.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Holy Spirit Replaces the Fallen Leadership System</strong><br>
                        Adam’s fall established a system of self-dependence. Jesus came to restore Heaven’s order—Spirit-led living. Every true believer must shift allegiance.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You can’t follow the world’s map and reach God’s mountain.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Guides Us Into the Inheritance of Mount Sion</strong><br>
                        Mount Sion is not just a destination—it’s a realm of divine reality accessible only by the Spirit’s guidance. He knows the path, for He is the path.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>No Spirit, no Zion. No Zion, no manifestation.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Spirit Is the Only Source That Sustains Supernatural Life</strong><br>
                        To live like Heaven on earth, God must be your Source. That means the Holy Spirit becomes your guide, your counselor, your provider, your strategist.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Survival in the Kingdom isn’t natural—it’s Spirit-sustained.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>Until the Holy Spirit becomes your Source, Mount Sion will remain a theory—not a reality. The glory of sonship only manifests where the Spirit is Lord. Our problem is not lack of information—but a lack of dependence. When God is not your source, you have already submitted to another. But if you truly let Him lead, you’ll not only qualify as a son—you’ll become a living expression of His Kingdom on earth.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Holy Spirit, I acknowledge You as the only Source of true Kingdom life. I repent for every time I depended on worldly systems more than You. Today, I surrender my heart, mind, and steps to Your leadership. Lead me into the fullness of Mount Sion. Deliver me from the illusion of independence. Make me a true son—led by You, fed by You, sustained by You. Manifest the government of God through me. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
