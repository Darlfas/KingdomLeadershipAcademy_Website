                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>The idea that a believer’s life is limited by ancestral sins or bloodline altars is a lie from the pit of hell. It is a deception that has hijacked many pulpits and diverted God’s children from the truth of the Gospel. Instead of walking in the liberty of Christ, many are caught in cycles of false warfare—battling shadows, blaming dead relatives, and fearing imaginary curses. But the Word of God is clear: You are not a product of your earthly bloodline—you are born of God. When you received Christ, you were repositioned into a superior bloodline, sealed by His blood, and empowered by His Spirit. The enemy’s greatest tactic is misdirection—convincing saints to fight fake battles so they never live in real victory. But truth must rise in this generation.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>Bloodline Teaching Is a Satanic Distraction</strong><br>
                        It misdirects spiritual warfare and keeps believers bound to the past.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>If Satan can’t steal your salvation, he’ll try to steal your attention.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The New Creation Is a Foundation Replacement</strong><br>
                        You didn’t just receive a blessing—you were made brand new.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Stop trying to break what Christ already buried.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Confused Believers Empower Imaginary Enemies</strong><br>
                        You can’t claim victory in Christ and still fear family altars.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Light and darkness cannot co-exist. Make a choice.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Jesus Never Taught Bloodline Warfare</strong><br>
                        Neither did Paul, Peter, James, or John. The apostles taught identity in Christ—not ancestral bondage.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>If it’s not in the New Covenant, it’s not for the New Creation.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Truth Alone Can Deliver This Generation</strong><br>
                        Jesus said, “You shall know the truth...” Yet many prefer traditions over truth.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Freedom isn’t a prayer point—it’s a revelation point.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>The concept of “bloodline foundation” has become a stronghold of spiritual fraud. It drains the Church of power, focus, and purpose. You must rise and reclaim your real identity. You are not cursed. You are not under any ancestral yoke. You are seated in Christ above all powers. Don’t waste your life fighting what Jesus already crushed. Wake up. Grow up. Search the Scriptures. Return to truth. The scam ends with you.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Lord Jesus, open my eyes to the simplicity of truth in You. I renounce every lie, tradition, and deception that exalts my past above Your finished work. I choose truth. I embrace my identity in Christ. I am a new creation—free, empowered, and complete in You. Use me to bring others out of this scam and into the light. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
