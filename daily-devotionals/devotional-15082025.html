                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>The will of God is not a suggestion—it is the condition for Kingdom life. Jesus declared in Matthew 7:21 that entry into the Kingdom is reserved for those who do the will of the Father. This reveals that doing God’s will is not optional; it is the essence of our calling and the proof of our alignment with Heaven. In Hebrews 10:7, Jesus said, “Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God.” This was His mission statement. If the Son of God lived by the Father’s will, how much more must we? Your predestination is incomplete without the pursuit and fulfillment of that will. The will of God is His original intent for creating you. It is the divine purpose that defines your existence, the eternal script written before time began. To ignore it is to waste life; to embrace it is to step into glory.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>The Will of God is the Eternal Blueprint</strong><br>
                        Hebrews 10:7—“I come… to do Thy will.”
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>God’s will is not random; it is the master plan for your life. Before you were born, Heaven already defined your purpose.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Will of God is the Condition for the Kingdom</strong><br>
                        Matthew 7:21—Not everyone who calls Him Lord enters, but those who obey His will.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Titles and talk do not guarantee Kingdom access; obedience does. Your confession must match your submission.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Will of God is the Original Intent of Creation</strong><br>
                        Genesis 1:26—Man was made to rule the earth as God rules heaven.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You exist to extend Heaven’s influence on earth. Any life outside this mandate is malfunctioning design.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Will of God is Discoverable and Doable</strong><br>
                        Ephesians 5:17—“Understand what the will of the Lord is.”
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>God does not hide His will to confuse you but to draw you closer. Through Scripture and the Spirit, you can know it—and do it.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Will of God is the Secret of Fulfillment</strong><br>
                        John 4:34—“My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me.”
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Real satisfaction comes when you accomplish the divine agenda. Nothing else will truly satisfy your soul.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>The will of God is not a mystery for speculation—it is a mandate for execution. You were born to fulfill what Heaven wrote. Destiny begins when you stop asking, “What do I want?” and start asking, “What does He will?” The greatest achievement in time is to finish the assignment of eternity.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Father, thank You for revealing Your will through Your Word and Spirit. Deliver me from self-will and align my heart with Your eternal purpose. Help me to live every day in obedience until I can declare like Jesus: “I have finished the work You gave Me.” In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY BIBLE READING</h3>
