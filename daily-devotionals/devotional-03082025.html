                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Abraham didn’t just believe in promises—he believed in a place. Mount Sion was not a New Testament idea; it was the eternal city that men of old longed for. Abraham walked through deserts with his gaze fixed on a heavenly destination. He wasn’t chasing land—he was pursuing a reality whose foundations were built by God Himself. Now, we who are in Christ have what Abraham only saw from afar. We have come to Mount Sion—not symbolically, but spiritually (Hebrews 12:22). That same City Abraham looked for is the eternal location of every born-again believer. We began there in eternity, and we are being drawn back there in glory. This is not just a hope—it’s a now-truth.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>Mount Sion Is Older Than Abraham’s Faith</strong><br>
                        The Golden City existed before time began. Abraham saw it, hoped for it, and shaped his life around it.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>True faith doesn’t just believe for things—it sees destinations.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Abraham Walked on Earth with His Eyes on Heaven</strong><br>
                        Though physically in tents, his spirit was anchored in eternity. This is the posture we must return to.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Earthly storms lose power when your eyes are fixed on Sion.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>We Now Dwell Where Abraham Only Dreamed</strong><br>
                        What was distant to Abraham is present for us. Through Christ, we’ve been spiritually relocated to Sion.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You’re not trying to get to Mount Sion—you’ve already come.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>This Revelation Produces Unshakeable End-Time Power</strong><br>
                        When you know your location in God, trials lose their grip. End-time pressure cannot collapse a soul fixed on Sion.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Revelation is your stability in tribulation.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Fixing Your Gaze on Mount Sion Is Your Rapture Readiness Key</strong><br>
                        The countdown has begun. If you don’t see where you're going, you’ll be distracted by where you are.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Focus on Mount Sion releases the strength to finish well.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>Abraham saw the City—we now live in it by the Spirit. But as the rapture morning draws near, we must set our eyes where he set his: on the eternal foundations of Mount Sion. This is more than a metaphor—it’s your divine origin, your present atmosphere, and your final destination. If you’re not living from Mount Sion, you’re living beneath your divine level.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Lord, just like Abraham, I choose to walk by faith and fix my eyes on the City with foundations—Mount Sion. I reject distraction and deception. Let the reality of Sion be more real to me than the chaos of this world. Anchor my soul in eternity. Empower me to walk through these last days with clarity, confidence, and fire. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
