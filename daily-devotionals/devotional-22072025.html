                <h2 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>The Mount of Transfiguration was not just a supernatural wonder—it was a response to the prayer of a man who lived like God. It didn’t happen randomly. It didn’t fall from the sky like lightning. It broke forth as He prayed. Luke 9:29 gives us the divine secret: Jesus was transfigured in prayer.</p>
                <p>Though the Apostles were present, they were sleeping. They saw the glory—but didn’t birth it. Jesus alone pressed into the presence of the Father until the veil of His humanity was torn, and the glory within Him exploded outward.</p>
                <p>And now, here’s the shocking truth: Jesus said we would do the same works—and even greater. (John 14:12) That means the Transfiguration Experience isn’t just historical—it’s prophetic. It's a divine preview of what happens when a God-man—a Spirit-filled believer—prays with heavenly focus and Kingdom burden.</p>
                <p>Heaven is still waiting for transfiguration moments. And they are not locked in the past—they’re possible in your present. In these final moments of the Church Age, God is calling believers not just to admire Jesus, but to imitate Him. Not just to watch the mountaintop, but to become the mountain through prayer.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h2>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Transfiguration Was Triggered by Focused Prayer</strong><br>Jesus wasn’t giving a sermon. He was praying. His glory didn’t appear in the crowd—it appeared in communion. He ascended the mountain to pray, and the heavens responded.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>When real God-men pray, dimensions shift and the earth sees glory.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Glory Was in Him All Along—Prayer Brought It Out</strong><br>Jesus didn’t borrow light from heaven. He released what was already inside. You too carry the indwelling Spirit (Rom. 8:11). The difference is activation.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You don’t pray to receive glory—you pray to reveal glory.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Transfiguration Can Be Reproduced by Spirit-Filled Believers</strong><br>Jesus said “the works that I do shall he do also.” (John 14:12). If transfiguration was one of His works—and it was—then it’s part of your spiritual inheritance.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Your closet can become your Mount of Transfiguration.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Sleeping Church Must Awaken to Its Responsibility</strong><br>While Jesus prayed, the Apostles slept. This is a picture of today's Church—present, but passive. Seeing, but not birthing. God is calling us to rise from slumber and travail in glory.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Watching Jesus is not enough—imitating Him is the mandate.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Church Must Demonstrate God in These Final Hours</strong><br>The last days are not for survival—they're for supernatural demonstration. Transfiguration moments will become evangelism tools, signs to this generation that God still lives in men.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The world doesn’t need another event—it needs an encounter with glory.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <div class="devotional-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY</h2>
                <p>The Transfiguration wasn’t just a miracle—it was a model. Jesus climbed the mountain, entered into prayer, and became a living revelation of the invisible God. And now, the baton has been passed to you.</p>
                <p>The world doesn’t need more religious programming—it needs evidence. It needs men and women whose secret place becomes their shining place. It needs believers who pray like Jesus, walk like Jesus, and glow like Jesus.</p>
                <p>This is not the time to sleep at the edge of glory. This is the hour to rise as God's prayer warriors, flame-bearers, and glory-carriers. The same power that burst through Christ in that sacred moment is waiting to break out of you.</p>
                <p>Prayer is no longer optional—it is the launching pad of transfiguration. You are not a spectator in God's story. You are His spotlight. It’s time to step into that fiery place of communion, and let your face shine with the light of another world.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="devotional-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">PRAYER</h2>
                <p>Father, I receive the revelation that You have called me to live the transfigured life. I thank You for the Spirit that dwells in me—the very glory of Heaven. Teach me to pray like Jesus. Awaken my spirit. Stir my hunger. Let my life become a mountain of glory and a light to this dark generation. I refuse to sleep through divine moments. Set me on fire in the secret place until I radiate Your presence in the open field. Let the world see Jesus in me. In Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
