                <h2 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>The Mount of Transfiguration was not just a moment of divine glory—it was a physical demonstration of Heaven’s agenda on earth. Jesus didn’t merely reveal His own divinity—He revealed the divine potential within every Spirit-filled believer. The same glory that radiated from Him is not a heavenly mystery; it’s a present possibility.</p>
                <p>Jesus’ words to Philip pull back the veil on His earthly mission: "He that has seen me has seen the Father." The assignment of Jesus was to be the express image of the invisible God, manifesting the reality of a Heaven-on-Earth lifestyle. And here’s the shocking truth: He wasn’t doing it as God alone—but as a man full of God. That’s what makes the Transfiguration our invitation.</p>
                <p>In these final hours of the age, the world is not waiting for another sermon—they’re groaning for the manifestation of sons (Romans 8:19). This generation doesn't need more church attendance—they need heavenly evidence. The same glory that flowed through Jesus must now shine through us. You are God's next transfiguration.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h2>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Jesus Was God’s Prototype of Heaven-on-Earth</strong><br>Christ came not only to die but to demonstrate—to show the blueprint of what God can do through a yielded vessel. His every word and work was sourced from the indwelling Spirit (John 14:10).</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Jesus didn’t just reveal God—He revealed you, the new creation in glory.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Transfiguration Was the Unveiling of Indwelling Glory</strong><br>The Father who dwelled in Jesus was revealed through Him. That inner glory burst outward in brilliant light on the mountain. Likewise, believers carry this treasure in earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7).</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The Spirit in you is not silent—it’s radiant, waiting to be revealed.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Same Works—And Greater—Are for Believers</strong><br>Jesus made a bold claim in John 14:12: "He that believeth on Me... greater works shall he do." The same Spirit that raised Christ and shone through Him now dwells in you (Rom. 8:11).</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Your faith is the gateway to your own transfiguration moments.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>This Generation Is Desperate for Demonstration</strong><br>In this dark age, words without power fall flat. What the world longs for is evidence of God. Transfiguration was divine proof—and now that assignment rests on the Church.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>God is looking for vessels of glory—not just talkers, but carriers.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>You Were Born for the Mountaintop, Not the Multitude</strong><br>While others stay in the crowd, God is calling you higher—to the mountain of transformation. Don’t just read about Jesus’ glory—manifest it. The world is waiting.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>What Jesus showed, you are anointed to continue. You are His proof on earth.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h2 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY</h2>
                <p>The Transfiguration was not just Jesus’ moment—it’s your mandate. Jesus came as the exact image of the Father so that you could become the exact image of the Son. He came to model the miraculous, the glorious, and the supernatural life that the Holy Spirit reproduces in all who believe.</p>
                <p>This is not the time for passive Christianity. The world is falling apart, and Heaven is counting on you to stand up as a visible expression of the invisible God. You are not ordinary. You carry the indwelling Spirit. And that means you carry glory.</p>
                <p>Heaven is not waiting to happen—it’s waiting to shine through you. Stop hiding. Stop hesitating. It’s time to rise, radiate, and reveal the glory within.</p>

            <div class="devotional-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">PRAYER</h2>
                <p>Father, I thank You for the divine prototype revealed in Jesus Christ. I believe that the same Spirit who dwelt in Him now dwells in me. I receive grace to walk in demonstration and not just in doctrine. Lord, take me to the mountain of intimacy, and let Your glory shine through my life. Make me a vessel of proof, a carrier of Your fire, and a reflection of Mount Sion. Let the world see You in me. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
