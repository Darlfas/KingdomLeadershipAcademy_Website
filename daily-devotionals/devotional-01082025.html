                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the beginning of a prophetic month—August 2025, a divine season of rediscovery. As we prepare for the return of our King, God is calling His sons and daughters back—not just to purpose, but to foundation. Mount Sion is not a fantasy for the far future; it is the blueprint of our eternal inheritance. But no structure can stand if its foundation is forgotten.</p>
                <p>A wise man once said, "If you forget your way, remember your beginning." This is why the Lord is commanding us to revisit the foundation of Mount Sion—because your origin holds the revelation of your destination. Everything God planned for you, every promise, every prophecy, every destiny—all of it was rooted in Sion before time began.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>Mount Sion Is Not Just Your Destination—It’s Your Design</strong><br>
                        Before you were born, you were wired with the DNA of Sion. You were created not just to visit it—but to belong there.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You don’t just walk into Mount Sion—you awaken to it.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Foundations Determine Futures</strong><br>
                        What you build your faith on will decide where you end up. Sion is a city built on truth, and only those whose lives rest on that truth will remain.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>No Sion without spiritual structure.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Forgotten Foundation Is the Reason for Religious Confusion</strong><br>
                        The Church today celebrates shadows but forgets the source. We sing about Heaven but ignore Sion—the eternal headquarters of the Kingdom.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Revival begins with re-alignment to your origin.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Foundation of Sion Is Found in the Word</strong><br>
                        Scripture reveals that we were ordained to inherit Sion as citizens of a holy nation. Every chapter points to the mountain of God where eternity begins.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You will never understand destiny until you rediscover origin.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>This Month Is a Divine Recall Back to Reality</strong><br>
                        God is not calling you to new excitement—He is calling you to ancient truth. This month is your opportunity to anchor deep, walk straight, and finish strong.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>This is not a season for noise—it’s a season for roots.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>Mount Sion is not just a place—it’s the eternal foundation of your Kingdom life. As the final chapter of the Church age unfolds, God is shaking everything not rooted in Him. This month, you are being summoned to return to the origin of your calling, your inheritance, and your destiny. Forget distractions. Dig deep. Prioritize truth.</p>
                <p>You cannot walk into the future of Sion until you return to its foundation.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Father, thank You for calling me back to my origin. Let every false structure in my life collapse, and let only what is rooted in You remain. Holy Spirit, open my eyes to the foundation of Mount Sion. Help me rediscover the blueprint of my inheritance and walk boldly into my eternal identity. Let this month be a divine reset—back to truth, back to power, back to destiny. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
