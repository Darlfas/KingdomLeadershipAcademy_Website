                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Many believers are still deceived into thinking that their earthly ancestry is the source of their identity and battles. But the truth is, you are not of this world! The moment you were born again, your citizenship was transferred from earth to Mount Sion, the heavenly Jerusalem. Jesus, our model, never identified with His natural roots. He boldly declared, “I am from above...” (John 8:23). And as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17). When you understand your citizenship, you will no longer accept doctrines that connect you to earthly foundations. Your true foundation is Christ, and your birth certificate is stamped from Sion—not from your grandfather’s village.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>You Are Not From Here</strong><br>
                        Jesus said we are in the world but not of it. Your spiritual passport says “Heavenly.”
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Earth may be your assignment—but Heaven is your origin.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mount Sion Is Your Real Birthplace</strong><br>
                        Psalm 87 declares that you were born in Zion. This is not a metaphor—it’s your eternal truth.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Sion is not your destination; it's your location.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Knowing Your Citizenship Destroys Earthly Limitations</strong><br>
                        If you believe you’re from your village, you’ll inherit its battles. But if you know you’re from Heaven, you’ll walk in victory.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Revelation of origin determines manifestation of authority.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Your Foundation Is the Person of Christ</strong><br>
                        No other foundation is allowed in the New Covenant. You are built on Christ, not on ancestors.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Stop digging through family trees—start standing on the Rock.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ignorance of Your Identity Is the Devil’s Playground</strong><br>
                        The devil thrives on spiritual ignorance. The moment you discover your true citizenship, the scam collapses.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Truth is not optional—it is survival.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>You are not a Nigerian first, or an African first, or a product of your earthly tribe. You are a citizen of Heaven, born in Mount Sion, and established on the eternal foundation of Christ. Any gospel that connects your present identity to your ancestral past is anti-Christ in disguise. It’s time to unplug from cultural bondage and walk in your Kingdom citizenship with boldness and light. Heaven is your homeland. Christ is your Foundation. Zion is your address.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Father, I thank You for revealing my true origin in Christ. I reject every lie that ties me to the limitations of this world. Open my eyes to see Mount Sion as my reality. Let this revelation of my heavenly citizenship reposition me in authority, purity, and dominion. I declare that Christ is my only foundation—and I walk in that truth boldly and victoriously. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
