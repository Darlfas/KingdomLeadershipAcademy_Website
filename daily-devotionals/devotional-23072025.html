                <h2 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>Transfiguration was not just a supernatural event—it was a divine classroom. Jesus wasn’t just revealing the glory of Heaven; He was training His disciples to see it, understand it, and one day walk in it.</p>
                <p>But within this glorious encounter lies a stunning truth: while divinity was revealed, humanity was exposed. The three Apostles—Peter, James, and John—were not there by favoritism, but by faith. And yet, even in that glorious atmosphere, their humanity showed through: slumber, distraction, and misunderstanding.</p>
                <p>This episode is a call for today’s Church to discern the divine, engage with glory, and respond accurately in holy moments. Transfiguration is still possible—but we must learn the human lessons embedded in this divine event.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h2>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Divine Invitation Was for All, Not a Select Few</strong><br>All twelve Apostles knew of the upcoming encounter (Matt. 17:1 says “after six days”), but only three ascended. Why? Faith and intimacy qualified them. God doesn’t show favoritism—He responds to hunger.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>The Kingdom rewards pursuit, not position.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Presence Without Participation Is a Missed Opportunity</strong><br>While Jesus prayed, they slept. Though physically present at the mountain of glory, they were spiritually disengaged. Transfiguration happened before them, but not through them.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Being around glory is not enough—engagement births transformation.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The Flesh Always Misinterprets the Move of God</strong><br>Peter, moved by wonder but not by wisdom, wanted to build tents—a carnal response to a celestial encounter. This is a prophetic picture of modern Christianity: trying to package glory instead of participating in it.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>God doesn’t want a monument to the moment—He wants movement with His will.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Divine Encounters Must Lead to Divine Focus</strong><br>Heaven had to interrupt Peter's idea with a booming correction: “This is My Son… hear Him.” The Father redirected their attention—not to the experience, but to the person of Christ.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Don’t idolize the manifestation—obey the Messenger.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Human Weakness Is No Excuse—It’s a Call to Press In</strong><br>Even though the Apostles missed full participation, they were being trained. Their failure was not final—it was formative. God was preparing them for a future where they would be transfigured by the indwelling Spirit.</p>
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Glory is not for the perfect—it’s for the pressing.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h2 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY</h2>
                <p>The Transfiguration reveals more than just Christ’s divinity—it exposes our humanity. God invited the disciples into an encounter, not to entertain them, but to equip them. And though they stumbled in slumber and misunderstood the moment, they were being shaped for the assignment ahead.</p>
                <p>This is not the hour for passive participation. This is the hour for active intimacy. You are not disqualified by weakness—but you are invited into glory by faith. Don’t sleep through the moments of transformation. Don’t settle for a fleshly interpretation of divine activity. Don’t try to build tents when God is opening portals.</p>
                <p>You were not saved to spectate—you were called to participate. If the same Spirit that raised Christ dwells in you, then transfiguration is your portion too. Step beyond the crowd. Press beyond the sleep. Look beyond the light—and see the face of the Son.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="devotional-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">PRAYER</h2>
                <p>Father, I thank You for the revelation that divine encounters demand my participation. I refuse to sleep in sacred moments. Awaken my spirit to press into the fullness of what You’re offering. Forgive me for every time I responded to Your glory with carnal thinking. I choose to hear the voice of Your Son. Let my faith qualify me for the mountaintop. Train me, transform me, and let me never waste holy opportunities again. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
