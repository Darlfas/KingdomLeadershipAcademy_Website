                <h3 class="section-title">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Before you ever stepped into time, you existed in eternity. Before your first breath on earth, your destiny was sealed in the blueprint of Mount Sion. God did not begin your story at your birth—He finished it at the foundation. The Christian life is not a random hustle to find purpose; it is a prophetic replay of an already written script. Mount Sion is not just your destination—it was also your beginning. The fall of man created a detour, but through Christ, the path has been restored. Now, through the new birth, you are invited to return—not to a new place—but to your original location in God. The moment you believed, you didn’t just receive a new life—you reconnected with an old one. This is not just theology—it is spiritual technology.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">TODAY’S LESSON (5-Point Summary)</h3>
                <ol class="lesson-points">
                    <li><strong>You Began in Eternity, Not in Time</strong><br>
                        Your origin is older than creation. God finished your works before He formed your body.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You are not finding your life—you are remembering it.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mount Sion Was in the Blueprint from the Start</strong><br>
                        Sion wasn’t an afterthought—it was the original setting of your identity and rest.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>What God starts in Sion, He finishes in Sion.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Fall Distracted Man from His Original Location</strong><br>
                        Sin didn’t destroy the plan—it distracted the path. But redemption through Christ reconnects you to where you began.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Salvation is the restoration of memory and position.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Faith Unlocks Rest Because Rest Was Preloaded</strong><br>
                        You're not earning rest—you’re re-entering it. You’re not building destiny—you’re walking into a prepared one.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>Faith is the vehicle; rest is the atmosphere.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>This Revelation Is the Final Leap to Mount Sion</strong><br>
                        The Church must stop living as if Sion is a future reward. It is a present reality we must remember, reclaim, and return to.
                        <p class="lesson-takeaway"><em>You started in Sion. You are headed to Sion. Live from that consciousness now.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="section-title">DAILY TAKEAWAY (SUMMARY)</h3>
                <p>You are not becoming something—you are returning to who you’ve always been in Christ. Mount Sion is not the end of your race; it was the launchpad of your spiritual identity. The only thing left is to align your daily life with your eternal script. This awareness will cancel stress, silence confusion, and awaken divine confidence. The mystery is clear: Your beginning was Mount Sion—and your end is Mount Sion.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">PRAYER</h3>
                <p>Father, open my eyes to my true origin in You. Let the veil of forgetfulness be torn, and let the light of Mount Sion flood my soul. Holy Spirit, teach me to live from the foundation, not from fear. Help me to see that nothing in my life is random—every step has already been written. I receive the rest that comes from knowing I began in You and I will finish in You. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
